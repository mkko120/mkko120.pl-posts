# This is the new website that I made!
With help of Greta (who worked on the design I adore) the dream of having a professional website finally came to life.


This design features:
 - a simple landing page
 - an about me
 - a blog with content hosted on github

It is far better than the older one and with help of Next.js magic tricks I even managed to implement rich metadata and a dynamic sitemap.
