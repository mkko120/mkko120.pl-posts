And everyone was like way to go, you made Beverly cry on her last day in rehab. 
So the thing I keep thinking about is, was it worth it for Beverly to be happy for a little bit, even though it ended up sad? 
Or would it be better if the whole thing would have never happened? 
Every time someone leaves rehab, it makes you think about your own progress, some days it feels like you're not progressing at all, other days you think "Well, maybe a little." 
The main thing I think about is how stupid I am that I didn't do this sooner. 
I wasted so many years because I was miserable because I assumed that was the only way to be. 
But I don't wanna do that anymore.
Also, am I crazy or have I gotten really good at writing letters? 

This is BoJack, by the way, Horseman, obviously.
